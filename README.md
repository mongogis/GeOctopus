GeOctopus
=====
GeOctpus is a library that implements algorithmic algebra to help build distributed & parallel processing procedure much faster and easier.

what is algorithmic algebra?
==================
algorithmic algebra is a novel theory built to use algebra operators to organize algorithms so that distributed and parallel processing procedures can be easily cope with.

Architecture
============
TBD.
